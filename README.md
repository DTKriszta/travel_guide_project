## Goal of the project
The goal of this analysis is to help a fictional startup get more information about its customers to improve decision-making.

**Main questions**
- In which country should Dilan prioritise his effort and why?
- Any other advice to Dilan on how to be smart with his investments based on the data from the last 3 months?
- Can you see any more interesting information (beyond the above 2 questions) in the data from which Dilan could profit?

## Introduction
Dilan is a world traveler and a solo entrepreneur. He writes a travel blog where he sells info products: a $8 e-book (World Travelers' Best Practices) and a $80 video course (How To Travel the World).

On his blog he has thousands of readers every day, coming from three sources: Reddit, SEO and AdWords.

Dilan writes about his travel experiences covering the 6 main continents of the planet - these are the main categories on the blog.

The business strategy is simple:
- New readers visit the blog.
- They read articles.
- They subscribe to the newsletter.
- They purchase the info products.
  
Dilan's travel blog is available in 8 (and only 8) different countries.

The marketing budget is not too high at the moment: Dilan spends only ~$1000 a month combined:
- for Adwords advertisement (~$500 a month for paid ads),
- for SEO (~$250 a month for editing) and
- or Reddit (~$250 for content creation)

And he only has two products!

He wants to invest more (time, work and money). But how to do that the most efficiently? What should he focus on?

## Data
The dataset for this analysis is raw user activity data from Dilan's blog between 1 January 2018 and 31 March 2018. It's a log with ~600.000 rows.
